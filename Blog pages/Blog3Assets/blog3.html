      <h3>What is camping</h3>
      <p>
        Camping is a recreational activity that involves spending time outdoors, <br>
        typically in a natural setting such as a <br>
        forest, mountain, beach, or campground. <br>
        It is a popular way for people to escape the hustle and bustle
        <br>of daily life and connect with nature. <br>
        Camping can be enjoyed by individuals, families, and groups of friends. <br>

      <h3>Camping Essentials</h3>
      <p>
        1.A Tent - available in a variety of sizes, a good rule of thumb is to aim for a tent that sleeps 1 or 2 people
        more than you need, for space for all your camping essentials! <br>
        2.Tent Pegs - will keep your tent firmly rooted in the ground, making your tent more durable, strong, and able
        to withstand beach and coast winds. <br>
        3.Sleeping Bags offering the perfect night's sleep in the outdoors! Available in two to four-season variations,
        sleeping bags offer warmth and comfort for all-season camping. <br>
        4.A Sleeping Mat, Air Bed, or Camp Bed for each camper. Easy-to-set up, Airbeds are cheap and comfortable and
        offer a great night's sleep. <br>
        5.Pillows - easy to forget, but make a huge difference to a good night's sleep, providing extra comfort to your
        camping sleeping set up. Inflatable pillows are an excellent choice for camping, offering easy transportation
        and saving storage space. <br>
        6.Camping Stove - a versatile method for cooking meals and heating water in the outdoors. Don't forget to take
        the correct type of fuel for your camping stove model! <br>
        7.Cooking Pans & Utensils - a common camping cooking mistake is forgetting to bring camping cooking equipment,
        bring your cooking pans & utensils for a variety of excellent outdoor meals around the campfire. <br>
